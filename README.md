# Simple-Expense-Tracker

This project is a basic **Expense Tracker** written in Python.  
It demonstrates the concepts of **Try...Except, String Formatting, User Input, and Virtual Environment** learned from W3Schools.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **User Input**: Ask the user for an expense name and amount.  
- **Try...Except**: Handle invalid inputs (like entering letters instead of numbers).  
- **String Formatting**: Display expenses in a neat formatted way (e.g., `$50.00 on Food`).  
- **Virtual Environment**: Can be run inside a Python virtual environment for isolation.

### Case 2: Invalid Input (Handled by Try...Except)
